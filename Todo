- would like router cmd-line timestamps based on login.  suggest .cloginrc
  knob for pre-cmd ("post-login"), pre-interactive-cmd ("post-interactive-
  login"), and the like.  it would need to be per-mfg, ie: either know the
  mfg of the device or assume it from the *login cmd used.  eg:

        add pre-cmd *   term monitor
        add pre-cmd-ios *       term monitor

- it would be useful to log commands that are permission denied rather than
  just failing.  it was mentioned on cisco-isp list.
- login script should catch output to stdout/user, so that if the rancid script
  exits prematurely, such as due to a cmd authorization failure, the user
  doesnt get a tcl traceback
  See http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TclCmd/catch.htm
  - related; could also add an error msg for required command like write term
    in the authorization failure case:
	return(-1) if (/command authorization failed/i);
- '% clogin clogin' w/ ssh default produces a tcl traceback
- sup2t show version info is missing
- RSP440 show version info is missing, eg:
  !Chassis type: ASR9K Series - a ASR9K Series router
- make *login and login.top.in cmdline options common among all scripts
- cpu info missing from sup-2t

- rivlogin is a mess
- why does hlogin fail when the host key is not yet known?  eg:
  unix% ./hlogin procurve
  procurve
  spawn hpuifilter -- ssh -c 3des -x -l user procurve
  Host key verification failed.

  Error: Couldn't login
  This happens on solaris only; linux and netbsd seem to be ok.
- lg.conf(5) needs the query stuff documented.
- configure OLDTIME per-group
- could the cloginrc match function do a longest-match search instead of
  first match?
- look at Andreas Dahl's Brocade switch collection scripts
- noenable should handle a value properly.  i.e.: 1 == noenable, 0 == enable or
  perhaps don't clear the -noenable cmd-line option.  the manpage needs to be
  fixed as well.  see msg from fred jordan.
- recent hp procurve s/w does not seem have show flash or show module
- would like to have a "pre-login-sequence" cloginrc directive, see
  rancid-disuss message from mike ethridge 16/may
- would like to have a "timeout" cloginrc directive
- would like to have a ssh "passphrase" cloginrc directive
- would like to have a "login_option" cloginrc directive to specify arbitrary
  command-line options
- possibly a "debug" (exp_internal 1 ?) cloginrc directive?  *login -d flag
  for same?  warning about filling logs?
- on 6500, show boot and show bootvar produce the same output and both appear
  in the crunched config.  should one be filtered?
- fix varargs for knf in util.c
- isis filtering for foundry?
- hlogin hangs when the procurve does not ask for passwords
- share/ tool to prune cvs versions, excluding those with tags, by (all but
  latest | keep N versions | keep N days/months/years)
- extreme collection fails for tacacs-enabled boxen due to diffs in UI - blech!
- xrancid should collect both of these:
	show configuration
	show configuration detail
- FILTER_PWDS knob is not implemented in alteon, bay, ezt3 or redback due to
  lack of h/w to test against.  need help from the community.
- should par's -c override an input files' : cmd?
- should *login emmit "clogin error:" or "*login error:" to make matches for
  login failures definitive?
- would like hpuifilter to be more friendly to interactive logins
- hpuifilter needs to allocate a pseudo terminal to work with ssh
	Pseudo-terminal will not be allocated because stdin is not a terminal.
- rancid with zebra via vtysh?
- rancid for unix?
- would be nice if it were possible to add additional commands to be run
  per-platform as a user desires.  how could the user also provide a
  filtering routine?
- a format such as {<user>} as the pwd in .cloginrc to indicate *login should
  prompt the user for the password
- implement the bits marked unimplemented in lg.conf
- detect 'same' vty configs
	- ignoring length/width/passwd is a start, but need more
- merge clogin and jlogin (or *login !!) into one.  possible?
- flogin (for foundry) needs more testing and should be integrated with
  clogin when foundry fixes their UI.
- flogin needs to be fixed for the userpasswd bug seen in jlogin 1.17, but
  this is clouded by the UI mess.
- rancid needs to treat the 3600s like the 7Ks and 12Ks...
  Also, need to allow 12012s, and force 700s to not be treated like 7Ks.
- LG should sort routers
- LG {requested} command additions
	- show controllers T3 (data)
	- handle redback in the looking glass
	- show ip as-path-access-list
	- show access-list
	- show ip community-list
	- show ip route-map
- prancid - lots of GC'ing to be done
- prancid - sort logging file by filename.  e.g.:
	logging file messages facility kernel level debugging
	logging file log facility any level debugging
	logging file log archive files 10 size 10m
	logging file messages archive files 10 size 10m
  then, sort by facility,  e.g.:
	logging file messages facility kernel level debugging
	logging file messages facility authorization level debugging
- should we add CVS ID header to saved configs?  configurable option? - idea

- Why does nlogin use a gratuitiously different variable name for the device(s)
  in the main loop?
