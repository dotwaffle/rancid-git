.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rancid-cvs
[\fB\-V\fR] [group [group ...]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rancid-cvs

for each rancid group and handles the revision control system (CVS, 
Subversion or Git) set-up.
It must be run after installation and whenever a rancid group is added.
.\"
.PP
.B rancid-cvs
reads
.BR rancid.conf (5)
to configure itself, then proceeds with the initialization.
First of the CVS, Subversion or Git repository, if necessary, and then for each
of the rancid groups listed on the command-line or those in the variable
.I LIST_OF_GROUPS
from
.BR rancid.conf (5),
if the argument is omitted.
.\"
.PP
Running
.B rancid-cvs
for groups which already exist will not cause problems.  If the group's
directory already exists, the import into the revision control system
will be skipped, and if it's
.BR router.db (5)
already exists, it will not be altered.

The command-line options are as follows:

The best method for adding groups is add the group name to
.I LIST_OF_GROUPS
in
.BR rancid.conf (5),
then run
.B rancid-cvs.  Do not create the directories manually, allow rancid-cvs
to do it.
