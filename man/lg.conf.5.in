.SH NAME
lg.conf \- looking glass configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lg.conf
contains configuration for the looking glass scripts.
.PP
The syntax is that of
.IR perl (1).
It is used to set variables that affect run-time behavior and/or to locate
resources.
.\"
.SH VARIABLES
The following variables are used (alphabetically):
.Bl -tag -width flag
.\"
.TP
.B LG_AS_REG
*** not implemented.
.\"
.TP
.B LG_BGP_RT
Allows show ip bgp neighbor commands that can produce heavy output, such as
sh ip bgp neighbor <ip> advertised-routes for a transit customer when the
neighbor address is followed by 'advertised-routes' for the sh ip bgp neighbor
query.
.\"
.TP
.B LG_CACHE_DIR
Sets the location of the cache directory.  The looking glass uses this
to hold lock files, log files, and output from cached commands.
.sp
Default: ./tmp
.sp
Note that the default is relative to the directory where
.IR lg.cgi
runs in the server's document root (e.g.: /usr/local/www/data/lg/tmp).
.\"
.TP
.B LG_CACHE_TIME
Sets the number of seconds that the looking glass should cache output from
commands that tend to produce a lot of output, such as 'show ip bgp
dampened-paths'.
.sp
Default: 600
.\"
.TP
.B LG_CLOGINRC
Defines the location of the
.BR cloginrc (5)
that the looking glass should use.  The path may be relative to the directory
where the CGI scripts run in the server's document root.
.sp
Default: $HOME/.cloginrc
.sp
Note that the .cloginrc must be readable by the user or group that will be
running the CGI and that
.BR clogin (1)
will not allow a world readable
.IR .cloginrc .
The user is normally that of the http server (httpd).
.\"
.TP
.B LG_IMAGE
Defines a html image tag (<img>) which, if defined, will be included at
the top of the looking glass pages.  It may contain any html as it is
simply handed off to print().
.sp
Example: $LG_IMAGE="<img src=/icons/rancid.gif hspace=0>\\n <font size=+2>FOO</font>";
.\"
.TP
.B LG_INFO
Defines information in html format which, if defined, will be included at
the bottom of the looking glass form page.  It may contain any html as it is
simply handed off to print().
.sp
Example: $LG_INFO="For Support contact <a href=mailto:webmaster\@localhost>webmaster</a>";
.\"
.TP
.B LG_LOG
Defines the fully qualified path name (i.e.: begins with '/') for the log file
or the
.BR syslog (3)
facility to use for logging.  For syslog, the argument is the lowercase name
of a syslog facility (see syslog.h) without the 'LOG_' prefix.
.sp
Example: local0
.sp
Default: $LG_CACHE_DIR/lg.log
.\"
.TP
.B LG_ROUTERDB
Sets the location for the
.IR router.db
file in rancid's
.BR router.db (5)
format.  It lists the devices that should be available to the looking glass
users.  Only those devices of supported types and with state 'up' are made
available.  If not defined and the default file does not exist, the looking
glass will compile a list from the router.db files of all the groups present
in rancid, that is, the list will be a concatenation of the available
.IR router.db (5)
files.
.sp
Note that if the concatenation method is used, it may be necessary to alter
the mode of the router.db files in the rancid group directories, since rancid's
default umask is 027 (see
.BR rancid.conf (5)).
.\"
.TP
.B LG_STRIP
Causes the LG to strip login information from the looking glass results.
Since Expect often munges disabling echo when passwords are entered,
this is a SECURITY CONCERN!  However, this output can be very useful for
debugging clogin problems.
.\"
.TP
.B LG_STYLE
Defines the URL of a style sheet to be used for HTML formatting.
.\"
.TP
.B PATH
Is a colon separated list of directory pathnames in the file system
where rancid's login scripts,
.IR clogin (1)
etc.)
and programs needed within these, such as
.IR telnet (1),
are located.
Its value is set by configure.  Should it be necessary to modify PATH,
note that it must include $BASEDIR/bin (see above).

.SH ERRORS
.B lg.conf
is interpreted directly by
.IR perl (1),
so its syntax follows that of perl.  Syntax errors may produce quite unexpected
results.
.SH FILES
.Bl -tag -width @sysconfdir@/rancid.conf -compact
.TP
.B @sysconfdir@/lg.conf
Configuration file described here.
.sp
.B lg.conf
is located by the value of the environment variable LG_CONF, in the CWD
(current working directory), or the sysconfdir defined when rancid was
installed, in that order.
.El
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR cloginrc (5),

.BR router.db (5)
.\"
.SH HISTORY
In RANCID releases prior to 2.3,
.B lg.conf
was located in the util/lg sub-directory of the install path.  This was
changed to be more consistent with common file location practices.
