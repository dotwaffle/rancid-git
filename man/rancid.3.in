.SH NAME
rancid \- rancid perl module
.SH INTRODUCTION
The
.B rancid
library provides functions for handling rancid.types configuration files,
loading modules, and the basic global variables, variables from parsing
rancid.types files, and output handling functions that are common to all
rancid device modules, all of which are "exported" (in perl terms) for use
by those that import the module.
Specifically, the library is used by
.BR grancid (1),
but it could be used by any perl program for site-specific handling or
additional automata.
.PP Input handling functions:
.TP
.B RunCommand(*input, *output, command)
Parse a single command that returns no required info; the output is dropped.
This could be used as the processing function in a command definition in
a rancid.types file.
.\"
.PP
Output handling functions:
.sp
.TP
.B ProcessHistory(tag, command, command argument, string)
Save the configuration on exit, if the device prompts at logout time.
This only has affect when used with -s.
XXX
.\"
.TP
.B keysort(XXX)
A sort routine that will sort on the keys of a hash as if it were a normal
array.
For example:
.sp
.nf
ProcessHistory("TAG","keysort","B0","!\\n");
ProcessHistory("TAG","keysort","D0","!\\n");
.fi
.sp
B0 and D0 are the sort keys.
.\"
.TP
.B valsort(XXX)
A sort routine that will sort on the values of a hash as if it were a normal
array.
.sp
.nf
ProcessHistory("TAG","valsort","","!B0\\n");
ProcessHistory("TAG","valsort","","!D0\\n");
.fi
.\"
.TP
.B numsort(XXX)
A numerical sort routine (ascending).
.\"
.TP
.B ipsort(IPv4 dotted-quad)
A sort routine that will sort on the ip address when the ip address is
anywhere in the strings.
.sp
.nf
ProcessHistory("TAG","ipsort","192.168.0.0","!B0\\n");
ProcessHistory("TAG","ipsort","192.168.1.0","!D0\\n");
.fi
.\"
.TP
.B sortbyipaddr(XXX)
A sort routine that will sort based upon IPv4 addresses.
.PP
Please see the library code for export variables.
