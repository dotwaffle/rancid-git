#
#
# LG_CACHE_DIR	is the location of the cache directory.  the LG uses this
#		to hold lock files, the default log file (lg.log), and o/p from
#		commands that can be very verbose.  it defaults to "tmp",
#		i.e.: relative to the directory where lg.cgi runs in your
#		server's (httpd) DocumentRoot (e.g.:
#		/usr/local/www/data/lg/tmp).
#
#$LG_CACHE_DIR="./tmp";
#
#
# LG_CACHE_TIME	is the number of seconds the LG should cache o/p from certain
#		commands; those that tend to produce a lot of o/p, such as
#		'show ip bgp dampened-paths'.  it defaults to 600 seconds
#		(10 minutes).
#
#$LG_CACHE_TIME=600;
#
#
# LG_CLOGINRC	is the .cloginrc that the LG should use.  it defaults to
#		<prefix>/.cloginrc.  note that the .cloginrc must be readable
#		by the user or group (UID / GID) that will be running the CGI
#		and the clogin (and friends) will not allow a world readable
#		.cloginrc.  this is normally the user the server (httpd) runs
#		under.
#
#$LG_CLOGINRC="$ENV(HOME)/.cloginrc";
#
#
# LG_IMAGE	is the filename of an image you wish to appear at the top
#		of the LG pages.  it can also be other html goo, like
#		the first example.  this is just handed to print, so \n and
#		the like will work and mind the character escapes (backslashes).
#
#$LG_IMAGE="<img src=/icons/rancid.gif hspace=0>\n <font size=+2>FOO</font>";
#$LG_IMAGE="<img src=rancid.gif hspace=0>\n";
#
#
# LG_INFO	is info in html format to output at the bottom of main form.
#		it might be local contact information, disclaimer, etc.  this
#		is just handed to print, so \n and the like will work and mind
#		the character escapes (backslashes).
#
#$LG_INFO="For support, contact <a href=\"mailto:webmaster\@localhost\">webmaster</a>";
#
#
# LG_LOG	is either a FQPN (fully qualified path name) or the syslog
#		facility to use for logging.  if not defined, the LG
#		will log to LG_CACHE_DIR/lg.log.  possible syslog facility
#		values are from the facility codes in /usr/include/syslog.h
#		minus the 'LOG_' and lower case.
#
#$LG_LOG="$LG_CACHE_DIR/lg.log";
#$LG_LOG="/tmp/lg.log";
#$LG_LOG="local0";
#
#
# LG_ROUTERDB	is the router.db in rancid's router.db format, listing
#		the routers and their platform that should be available to
#		the looking glass.  if defined, the LG will use this variable
#		to find the router.db.  if not defined, it will look for it
#		at <prefix>/<sysconfdir>/router.db.  if it does not exist, it
#		will build the list from <prefix>/*/router.db (i.e.: the
#		router.db's from all your groups).  note that if you choose
#		this last option; the group directories and router.db files'
#		modes may have to be changed, depending upon the UID/GID of
#		the user your server (httpd) runs under, since rancid's default
#		mask is 007 (see etc/rancid.conf).  routers not marked 'up' are
#		skipped.
#
#$LG_ROUTERDB="@sysconfdir@/router.db";
#
#
# LG_STYLE	define a style sheet to be used for formatting HTML.
#
#$LG_STYLE="http://www.your.site/style/style.css";
#
#
# Options:
#
# LG_AS_REG	*** not implemented.
#
#@LG_AS_REG=();
#
#
# LG_BGP_RT	allows a few bgp commands which can produce long output (heavy
#		router load), such as sh ip bgp neighbor <ip> advertised-routes
#		would for a transit customer or sh ip b neigh <ip>
#		received-routes would for a transit provider.
#
#$LG_BGP_RT=1;
#
#
# LG_SINGLE	serializes and limits queries per-router to one at a time via
#		per-router lock files.
#
#$LG_SINGLE=0;
#
# LG_STRIP	strips login o/p from the looking glass results.  Expect
#		occassionally screws up disabling echo when passwords are
#		entered (NOTE: SECURITY CONCERN).  However, this o/p can be
#		very useful for debugging clogin/flogin/jlogin problems.
#
$LG_STRIP=1;
#
#
# Commands/Queries:
#		Un-comment/Comment the commands that are desired/not desired.
#		The Commands are separated into a few categories.  The value
#		of each variable is the string which will appear in the
#		(lgform.cgi) menu.  Mind the ,'s within hash assignments.
#
#		The double-commented (##) queries are not implemented or have
#		not been tested.
