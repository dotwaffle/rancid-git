# LIST_OF_GROUPS (below).  In addition to these, there will be a "CVS"
# directory which is the cvs (or Subversion) repository.

# - any URL that subversion understands, but beware that:
#   - no attempt will be made to create the repository when running rancid-cvs.
#   - authentication credentials, if necessary, MUST be cached (see the SVN
#     book, Ch. 3, Network Model, Caching credentials) before non-interactive
#     commands can run, e.g. by running rancid-cvs after installation.
