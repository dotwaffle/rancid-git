#  RANCID - Really Awesome New Cisco confIg Differ
#

# h3crancid
#
# h3clogin/h3crancid covers the following product ranges:
#
#  * 3Com SuperStack 4 (from 'joint venture' with Huawei)
#  * H3C
#  * HP Networking ('A' & some 'E' portfolio, post-2010 3Com acquitision)
#
# They may also work with some Huawei equipment.
#
# https://sites.google.com/site/jrbinks/code/rancid/h3c

#
# Usage: h3crancid [-dltCV] [-f filename | hostname]
#

# You can modify the behaviour by changing the variables listed in
# 'END-USER TWEAKS', below.

# Notable changes from standard *rancid programs:
#
# * abstracted path to the 'tail' utility
# * altered "cisco_cmds" to be "device_cmds"
# * define and use $logincmd
# * abstracted $rancid_type

# TODO:
#
# It may be useful to pull common subroutines like the sorting ones into
# a library for use by all the *rancid programs.
#
# abstract the comment-out char (i.e., '!' here and cisco, '#' on Juniper)
# to a variable.

# NOTES:
# 
# * the dir commands need a user greater than at least level 1 on some
#   platforms
